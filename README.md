This is a one page application that shows my favorite New York city museums. Application loads Google map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

The application loads, shows a New York City Map with few Museums markers on it. Also there is a search menu on the left side, shows a list of all available ponts of interest. 
The user can perform a search by museum name, only selected "museum" marker would be visible on map when search is performed.
